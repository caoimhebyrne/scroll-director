Are you tired of macOS not having an independent setting for 'Natural Scrolling' on your Mouse and Trackpad? ScrollDirector will automatically disable natural scrolling whenever an external mouse is detected, and re-enable it when the mouse has been disconnected.

## Building

1. Clone the repository.
	```console
	$ git clone https://github.com/caoimhebyrne/scroll-director.git
	$ cd scroll-director
	```
2. Create a build config file, like the `BuildConfig.xcconfig.sample`.
	```console
	$ mv BuildConfig.xcconfig.sample BuildConfig.xcconfig
	```
3. Update the contents of the `BuildConfig.xcconfig` file to match your Developer ID.
4. Open the project in Xcode.

## Installation
